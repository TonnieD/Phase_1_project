# Aviation Accident Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes aviation accidents and safety trends using a dataset containing accident details, injuries, aircraft damage, and other relevant factors. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to aviation accidents through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

- Accident dates and locations

- Aircraft details (e.g., number of engines, aircraft damage,models and makes)

- Injury details (fatal, serious, minor, and uninjured counts)

- Causes and contributing factors

### Data Processing

Data Cleaning:

- Handled missing values and inconsistencies

- Converted data types where necessary

- Removed duplicate records

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Generated summary statistics

- Identified outliers and trends

Data Visualization:

- Line plots of accident trends over the years

- Histograms of numerical variables

- Correlation matrix to understand relationships

Scatter plots for injury distributions

- Tableau dashboard for interactive geographic visualization

## Key Findings

- A significant decline in aviation accidents over the years.

- Correlation between aircraft damage and severity of injuries.

- Higher number of accidents involving aircraft with more engines.

- Certain periods had spikes in accidents due to specific incidents.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations such as:

- Line plots showing accident trends

- Box plots highlighting outliers

- Histograms for frequency distributions

- Scatter plots comparing injuries and other factors

- A world map visualization in Tableau for geographical accident distribution

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and maps

- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization
